      <h1 class="title">About</h1>
      <p><span style="font-size: 1.3em;"> The Chingford &amp; District Model Engieering Club is situated on the eastern edge of London (E4) close to both the ‘North Circular’ Ring Road and the M11 Motorway. Our interests in various forms of Model Engineering, make us a very active club and we also run two-scale railway tracks which are able to carry passengers. A Gauge One layout is also nearing completion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.3em;">Situated in Ridgeway Park, Chingford E4 6XU, the railways are used to give rides to members of the public on Sunday and Bank Holiday Monday afternoons between April and the end of September from 2pm - 5:30pm. We Charge £1 for the Raised Track or £1.50 for the Ground Level Track.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.3em;">The Club is 73 years old. Our members come from all walks of life and do not necessarily have an engineering background. Membership is open to either gender and starts at 10 for Apprentices, 14 for Juniors and 18 years for full membership.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.3em;">We seeks to promote all forms of model engineering and model making, as shown on our club badge (Boats, Planes, Trains &amp; Static Models).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.3em;">What ever your project with a membership of over 100 you will always find someone with the answer to any problem you may have.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.3em;">Virtually every Sunday Morning throughout the year you will find a group of members at the track finding something to do, if it’s only having a cup of tea and a chat (there’s a lot of that).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.3em;">The club keeps a large stock of materials available to members at very low cost. We also have a library of books and videos on associated subjects always available, as is our club workshop which is fully equipped to do the larger jobs.</span></p>
