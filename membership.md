<span style="font-size: 1.3em;">Members generally meet informally at the club track every Sunday morning throughout the year and on Wednesday evenings (from 7pm) between May and September at our club track site in Ridgeway Park, Chingford.

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;">The track meetings are informal and include general maintenance of the site track and rolling stock and members running their own or club locomotives. We also have BBQs and special running evenings.

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;">As we need qualified drivers to operate the locomotives on our public running days, Wednesday evenings are also used for driver training.

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;">From September to May our Wednesday night meetings are held at St. Edmund's Church Hall, Larkswood Road, Chingford from 7.30pm until 9pm. These meetings are slightly more formal, with films, lectures, demonstrations and discussions on a wide variety of subjects.
